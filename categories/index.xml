      <title>Widening the Tent</title>

      <description>On April 22, 2017 I headed out to the Athens March for Science, while UGA Dawgs headed to Stanford stadium for the annual spring scrimmage football game. I saw this as a missed opportunity to bring together these two UGA-loving groups. This inspired me to launch STEMzone, an outreach organization that facilitates UGA STEM researchers communication with the broader Athens/UGA community during football tailgating (Read more about my inspiration and the first event).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; guide to launch STEMzone at your university. Please contact me, or the current e-board, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in starting this event at your University. I have plenty of lessons learned to share!

      <description>Clearly communicating scientific findings are as important as the findings themselves.
Important for the progress of science, but also for equity and inclusion.
I strive to be an effective educator. I have followed multiple approaches to develop my technical and non-technical communication skills.
Approach 1: Teaching Effective educators are dynamic communicators. They have developed methods to maintain engagement by soliciting real-time feedback, and reading non-verbal cues. This information is then used to alter the discussion so the student reaches the learning objective.</description>

      <title>The Road to Extinction</title>

      <description>My dissertation research focused on population ecology, spanning from theoretical to applied. I am interested in the general path populations take on the road to extinction. Theoreticians have developed models that capture what we think that road looks like. My work pushes these ideas forward by trying to re-create this theoretical road in a highly controlled laboratory setting. This work acts as a proof of concept before exploring these ideas in (an often messy) natural setting.</description>

      <title>Predicting disease dynamics</title>

      <description>I have a wide range of scientific interests, and enjoy collaborating with my Drake labmates. This has led to many projects that involve some combination of disease dynamics, machine learning, and modeling. Here are a few highlights.
Yellow fever in Brazil Explore the project&amp;rsquo;s [workflow on github].
The spread of yellow fever into areas previously thought of as low risk presented an ecologically interesting question- what’s changed about the disease dynamics in the region, and an important question for human health- can we predict areas of high risk for the disease.</description>
