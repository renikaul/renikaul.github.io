      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of writing a how to guide to bring STEMzone to your university. Please contact me, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in starting this event at your school. I have plenty of lessons learned to share!</description>

      <title>The Road to Extinction</title>

      <guid>/blogs/dissertation/</guid>
      <description>My dissertation research focuses on population ecology, spanning from theoretical to applied. I am interested in the general path populations take on the road to extinction. Theoreticians have developed models that capture what we think that road looks like. My work pushes these ideas forward by trying to re-create this theoretical road in a highly controlled laboratory setting. This work acts as a proof of concept before exploring these ideas in (an often messy) natural setting.</description>

      <title>Predicting disease dynamics</title>

      <description>I have a wide range of scientific interests, and enjoy collaborating with my Drake labmates. This has led to many projects that involve some combination of disease dynamics, machine learning, and modeling. Here are a few highlights.
Yellow fever in Brazil Explore the project&amp;rsquo;s [workflow on github].
The spread of yellow fever into areas previously thought of as low risk presented an ecologically interesting question- what’s changed about the disease dynamics in the region, and an important question for human health- can we predict areas of high risk for the disease.</description>
